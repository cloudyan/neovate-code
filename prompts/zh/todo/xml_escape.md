Automatically escapes special characters in XML/HTML files to make them valid. This tool will:
      - Replace < with &lt; (except in tags)
      - Replace > with &gt; (except in tags)
      - Replace & with &amp; (except in existing entities)
      - Replace " with &quot; (in attribute values)
      - Replace ' with &apos; (in attribute values)

      The tool intelligently detects which characters need escaping based on their context.
